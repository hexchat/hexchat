Just some tips if you're going to help with HexChat code (patches etc):

* Use tabs, not spaces, to indent code.

* Use a tab size of 3 (most editors will let you choose this).
  Type :set ts=3 in vim/gvim.

* Try to stick to the same consistant coding style:

void
routine (void)
{
	if (function (a, b, c))
	{
		x = a + 1;
	}
}

	(vertically aligned braces, a space after if, while, functions etc).

* Don't use "//" C++ style comments, some compilers don't like them.

* When opening a file with unix level functions (open, read/write, close)
  as opposed to the C-level functions (fopen, fwrite/fread, fclose), use
  the OFLAGS macro. This makes sure it'll work on Win32 aswell as unix e.g:

	fh = open ("file", OFLAGS | O_RDONLY);

* Use closesocket() for sockets, and close() for normal files.

* Don't read() from sockets, instead use recv().

* Please provide unified format diffs (run diff -u).

* Call your patch something more meaningfull than hexchat.diff (I get a
  million of these files!).

* To make a really nice and clean patch, do something like this:

Have two directories, unpacked from the original archive:
hexchat-2.0.0/
hexchat-2.0.0p1/
Then edit/compile the hexchat-2.0.0p1 directory. When you're done, make
a patch with:

cd hexchat-2.0.0p1
make distclean
cd ..
diff -urN hexchat-2.0.0 hexchat-2.0.0p1 > hexchat-something.diff

If using nmake (Windows) replace "make distclean" with "nmake -f makefile.msc clean"
