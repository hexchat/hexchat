What the fuck did you just fucking say about Hexchat, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in C++, and I've been involved in numerous open source Windows projects, and I have over 300 confirmed commits on github. I am trained in GTK+ and I'm the top GTK+ in GTK+. You are nothing but just another user. I will close your pull requests with immaturity the likes of which has never been seen before on this repo, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of GTK+ coders across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your pull request. You're fucking dead, kid.
