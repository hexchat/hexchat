<h2>1. Section One: Compiling and Installing.</h2>

<br/><h3><a name="q11">1. I get this error: /bin/sh: no: command not found</a></h3>
<p>
If you get an error something like:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
Making all in po
make[2]: Entering directory `/home/zed/xchat/files/xchat-1.8.7/po'
file=./`echo ca | sed 's,.*/,,'`.gmo \
  &amp;&amp; rm -f $file &amp;&amp; PATH=../src:$PATH no -o $file ca.po
/bin/sh: no: command not found
make[2]: *** [ca.gmo] Error 127
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/zed/xchat/files/xchat-1.8.7/po'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/zed/xchat/files/xchat-1.8.7'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It means you don't have GNU gettext installed. There are two solutions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Install GNU gettext and try again.</li>
<li>Use <i>./configure --disable-nls</i>. This will disable foreign
language support and all menus and GUI will be in english only.</li>
</ul>

<br/><h3><a name="q12">2. How do I compile X-Chat on my Sun OS system?</a></h3>
<p>
   X-Chat uses GNU gettext which in turn requires gmake, either install that
   and or use ./configure --disable-nls with Sun's own make.
</p>

<br/><h2>2. Section Two: Using X-Chat.</h2>

<br/><h3><a name="q21">1. How do I enable identd in X-Chat?</a></h3>
<p>
<u>UNIX:</u><br/>
    Identd isn't actually apart of X-Chat. You will need to download and install 
    your own ident server. Most distributions, including RedHat, come with an 
    ident server program called pidentd. Make sure it is enabled in
    /etc/xinetd.conf or read you distribution's documentation.

    As an alternative, you can try this experimental identd server: <a href="auth/index.html">xchat_auth</a>

<br/><br/><u>WINDOWS:</u><br/>
    The win32 version of X-Chat comes with a builtin identd server. It is
    enabled by default, but can be disabled with <i>/set identd 0</i>.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q22">2. How do I auto join more than one channel with keys?</a></h3>
<p>
   In the Serverlist's channel column enter multiple channels and separate 
   them by commas, eg:  "#linux,#warez,#chat". Do not put spaces between the
   channels. If the channels also have keys (passwords), then the syntax is:
   "#channel1,#channel2,#channel3 key1,key2,key3"
</p>
<p>
   Example: If you want to join #abc and #talk without keys, but #linux with
   a key of "secret", you would enter: "#linux,#abc,#talk secret".
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q23">3. How do I autoconnect and join a channel when X-Chat loads?</a></h3>
<p>
In the Serverlist, enable "Edit Mode", select the Network to want to auto-connect to,
and turn ON the "Auto connect at startup" checkbox.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q24">4. How do I cut and paste in X-Chat?</a></h3>
<p>
It's exactly the same as any other X application. You simply mark the text
you want, and then press middle mouse button to paste (if you only have a
2 button mouse, press left and right buttons at once).
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q25">5. How do I connect through a proxy?</a></h3>
<p>
Go to the menus, Settings -> Preferences -> Network Setup and fill in the requested
information there. There is currently no support for using a username and
password to authenticate to proxies.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q26">6. How do I show @ and + infront of nicknames that are Op and Voice when they talk?</a></h3>
<p>
To display @ and + characters next to nicknames as they talk, do the following:
</p>
<p>
In the menus, open up Settings -> Lists -> Text Events. Find the
<i>Channel Message</i> event in the list. The $3 code can be inserted to
print the user's mode-character (e.g. @ or +). For example, you might want
to change the default:
<br/><br/>%C2&lt;%O$1%C2>%O$t$2%O<br/><br/>To:
<br/><br/>%C2&lt;<b>%O$3</b>%O$1%C2>%O$t$2%O
<br/><br/>Don't forget to press Enter, so the changes take effect in the
list at the top of the window.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q28">8. How do I set different ban types?</a></h3>
<p>
   Three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
      Right click the nickname in the userlist, and choose a bantype from the
      "Kick/Ban" submenu.
</li>
<li>
		You can also do it manually:

         /ban &lt;nick> &lt;bantype>

      where the &lt;bantype> is a number from 0 to 3.
</li>

<li>
           /set irc_ban_type &lt;bantype>
      sets the default ban type to use for all bans. The different types are:

<ul>
<li>0 *!*@*.host</li>
<li>1 *!*@domain</li>
<li>2 *!*user@*.host</li>
<li>3 *!*user@domain</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<br/><h3><a name="q29">9. Why can't I see accented-letters/umlauts/upper-ascii-chars in X-Chat?</a></h3>
<p>
Refer to <a href="http://xchat.org/encoding.html">http://xchat.org/encoding.html</a>.<br/>
Note: Log files are always written in UTF-8/Unicode.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q210">10. Why does the timestamp overlap some nicknames?</a></h3>
<p>
Some networks allow very long nicknames (up to 32 letters). It can be annoying to have
the separator bar move too far to the right, just for one long nick. Therefore, it has
a set limit for the distance it will move to the right. If you use a large font, you
may need to adjust this distance. It is set in pixels, for example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
      /set text_max_indent 320
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Once you adjust this setting high enough, overlapping timestamps and nicknames should
not occur. The adjustment will not take effect immediately, a restart may be needed.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q211">11. How do I turn on Conference mode where I will not see join or part messages?</a></h3>
<p>
Right-click on the tab you want to change. In the submenu of the channel
name, there's a toggle-item "Show join/part messages", simply turn this off.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q212">12. How can I run the /dccserver command?</a></h3>
<p>
In short you can not do this (easily). This is a mIRC only proprietary feature
that is quite nonstandard. There is no code for doing this, mainly because
/dccserver runs on port 59 which in turn would require running X-Chat as
root. Why do you need this anyway? Just use normal DCC.
<br/><br/>
Unofficial <a href="http://dfx.at/xchat/">patches are available here</a>.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q213">13. Why doesn't DCC send work behind IPNat or IPMasq?</a></h3>
<p>
   If you are behind a IP-NAT or IP-Masqeraude system, you will most likely have
   an address like 192.168.0.0. This address is not useable on the internet, and
   must be translated.
</p><p>
   When offering a DCC file, xchat will tell the receiver your address. If it says
   192.168.0.0, the receiver will not be able to connect. One way to make it send
   your "real" address is to enable the "Get my IP from IRC Server" option in xchat.
   In version 2.0, it's available in Prefereces -> File Transfers. When you turn
   this option ON, you will have to relogin to the server before it'll take effect.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q214">14. How do I execute multiple commands in one line?</a></h3>
<p>
   There are two ways to do this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can create two UserCommands, with the same name, and then execute
      the UserCommand. It will be executed in the same order as it's written
      in the UserCommands gui.</li>
<li>/LOAD -e &lt;textfile>, where &lt;textfile> is a full pathname to a file
      containing commands on each line.</li>
</ul>

<br/><h3><a name="q215">15. How do I enable Emacs keybindings in XChat 2.0?</a></h3>
<p>
The standard Emacs keybindings, such as ctrl-w, ctrl-u etc, are supported by
GTK+ 2.0, but normally disabled. If you run Gnome 2, you can reenable them in
your Gnome menu under: Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts.
</p>
<p>
If you don't use Gnome 2, but still want Emacs keybindings, it's beyond the
scope of this document. You might find some hints here:
<a href="http://www.gtk.org/gtk-2.2.0-notes.html">GTK+ 2.2.0 release notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note, X-Chat versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 used the ctrl-w key for "Close Tab". Ctrl-w is recommended by the H.I.G for this purpose, but it conflicts with Emacs bindings. Version 2.0.2 changed the "Close Tab" binding to shift-ctrl-w, to avoid this conflict. In 2.0.3, ctrl-w is used for "Close Tab" when Emacs key bindings are disabled, and shift-ctrl-w when they are enabled. This solution should satisfy everyone.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q216">16. I get this error: "Unknown file type abc.yz. Maybe you need to install the Perl or Python plugin?"</a></h3>
<p>
If you get this error when trying to load a Perl or Python script, it means
the plugin for running those scripts isn't loaded.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Perl, Python and TCL plugins come with XChat in the same archive.</li>
<li>During ./configure, it will check for Perl, Python and TCL libs and headers, you should check if it failed there.</li>
<li>The plugins directory can be found by issuing the shell command
	<pre>strings `which xchat` | grep plugins</pre>
	Be sure to use the correct quotes.</li>
<li>All *.so files are autoloaded at startup (*.dll on Windows).</li>
<li>If you downloaded a binary package, maybe the packager decided to exclude the Perl or Python plugins.</li>
</ul>

<br/><h2>3. Section Three: Contributions, Development and Bugs.</h2>

<br/><h3><a name="q31">1. Why does X-Chat leak so much memory?</a></h3>
<p>
The simple answer is, it doesn't! There are some GTK+ pixmap based themes around that
leak alot of memory. Please try using a different theme and see if that resolves the
problem. X-Chat itself only allocates about 40kb of memory through malloc()!
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q32">2. My copy of X-Chat crashes, what can I do?</a></h3>
<p>
   Firstly, make sure it's the latest stable version of X-Chat. Stable versions have
   an EVEN middle number, e.g.: 2.0.1 or 2.0.2. Often late fixes are placed in this
   directory: <a href="http://xchat.org/files/source/2.0/patches/">2.0.x patches</a>
</p><p>
   If you still experience crashes, you should consider running it through GDB. This
   will help us find a fix quickly, and it's easy to do! See <a href="gdb.html">here</a>.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q33">3. Can I write a new language translation for X-Chat?</a></h3>
<p>
You sure can, but I don't accept translations directly. They must be done through the
<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/HTML/index.html">Translation Project</a>.
All the relevant information should be on that page.
