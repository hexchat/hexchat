<br/><br/>

<h2>1. Section One: Compiling and Installing.</h2>

<br/><h3><a name="q11">1. I get this error: /bin/sh: no: command not found</a></h3>
<p>
If you get an error something like:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
Making all in po
make[2]: Entering directory `/home/zed/xchat/files/xchat-1.8.7/po'
file=./`echo ca | sed 's,.*/,,'`.gmo \
  &amp;&amp; rm -f $file &amp;&amp; PATH=../src:$PATH no -o $file ca.po
/bin/sh: no: command not found

make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/zed/xchat/files/xchat-1.8.7'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
It means you don't have GNU gettext installed. There are two solutions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Install GNU gettext and try again.</li>
<li>Use <i>./configure --disable-nls</i>. This will disable foreign
language support and all menus and GUI will be in English only.</li>
</ul>

<br/><h3><a name="q12">2. How do I compile X-Chat on my Sun OS system?</a></h3>
<p>
   X-Chat uses GNU gettext which in turn requires gmake, either install that
   and or use ./configure --disable-nls with Sun's own make.
</p>

<br/><h2>2. Section Two: Using X-Chat.</h2>

<br/><h3><a name="q21">1. How do I enable identd in X-Chat?</a></h3>
<p>
<u>UNIX:</u><br/>
    Identd isn't actually apart of X-Chat. You will need to download and install 
    your own ident server. Most distributions, including RedHat, come with an 
    ident server program called pidentd. Make sure it is enabled in
    /etc/xinetd.conf or read you distribution's documentation.

    As an alternative, you can try this experimental identd server: <a href="http://xchat.org/auth/">xchat_auth</a>

<br/><br/><u>WINDOWS:</u><br/>
    The win32 version of X-Chat comes with a built-in identd server. It is
    enabled by default, but can be disabled with <i>/set identd 0</i>.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q22">2. How do I auto join more than one channel with keys?</a></h3>
<p>
   In the Server list's channel column enter multiple channels and separate 
   them by commas, eg:  "#linux,#warez,#chat". Do not put spaces between the
   channels. If the channels also have keys (passwords), then the syntax is:
   "#channel1,#channel2,#channel3 key1,key2,key3"
</p>
<p>
   Example: If you want to join #abc and #talk without keys, but #linux with
   a key of "secret", you would enter: "#linux,#abc,#talk secret".
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q23">3. How do I autoconnect and join a channel when X-Chat loads?</a></h3>
<p>
In the Server list, select the Network you want to auto-connect to, click Edit
and turn ON the "Auto connect to this network at startup" checkbox.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q24">4. How do I cut and paste in X-Chat?</a></h3>
<p>
It's exactly the same as any other X application. You simply mark the text
you want, and then press middle mouse button to paste (if you only have a
2 button mouse, press left and right buttons at once).
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q25">5. How do I connect through a proxy?</a></h3>
<p>
Go to the menus, Settings -> Preferences -> Network Setup and fill in the requested
information there. Authentication (using a username and password) is
only supported for HTTP and Socks5.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q26">6. How do I show @ and + in front of nicknames that are Op and Voice when they talk?</a></h3>
<p>
To display @ and + characters next to nicknames as they talk, do the following:
</p>
<p>
In the menus, open up Settings -> Advanced -> Text Events. Find the
<i>Channel Message</i> event in the list. The $3 code can be inserted to
print the user's mode-character (e.g. @ or +). For example, you might want
to change the default:
<br/><br/>%C2&lt;%O$1%C2>%O$t$2%O<br/><br/>To:
<br/><br/>%C2&lt;<b>%O$3</b>%O$1%C2>%O$t$2%O
<br/><br/>Don't forget to press Enter, so the changes take effect in the
list at the top of the window.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q27">7. How do I change the Op and Voice icons in the userlist?</a></h3>
<p>
The default icons are hard coded (compiled) in. You can override them by creating
some PNG files in ${PREFIX}/share/xchat. ${PREFIX} is usually /usr, so that
would translate to /usr/share/xchat. If you compiled from source tarball without
specifying a prefix, it will be /usr/local instead.
<br/><br/>Call the files op.png, hop.png, voice.png, red.png and purple.png. Red and Purple are used for Channel Owner and Founder. They will be loaded at the next startup.
<br/><br/>
<u>XChat 2.6.0+ on Windows</u>: On Windows the images will need to be ICO files:<br/>
C:\Program Files\XChat\Icons\op.ico<br/>
C:\Program Files\XChat\Icons\hop.ico<br/>
C:\Program Files\XChat\Icons\voice.ico<br/>
C:\Program Files\XChat\Icons\red.ico<br/>
C:\Program Files\XChat\Icons\purple.ico<br/>
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q28">8. How do I set different ban types?</a></h3>
<p>
   Three ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
      Right click the nickname in the userlist, and choose a ban type from the
      "Kick/Ban" submenu.
</li>
<li>
		You can also do it manually:

         /ban &lt;nick> &lt;ban type>

      where the &lt;ban type> is a number from 0 to 3.
</li>

<li>
           /set irc_ban_type &lt;ban type>
      sets the default ban type to use for all bans. The different types are:

<ul>
<li>0 *!*@*.host</li>
<li>1 *!*@domain</li>
<li>2 *!*user@*.host</li>
<li>3 *!*user@domain</li>
</ul>

</li>
</ul>

<br/><h3><a name="q29">9. Why can't I see accented-letters/umlauts/upper-ascii-chars in X-Chat?</a></h3>
<p>
Refer to <a href="http://xchat.org/encoding/">http://xchat.org/encoding/</a>.<br/>
Note: Log files are always written in UTF-8/Unicode.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q210">10. Why does the timestamp overlap some nicknames?</a></h3>
<p>
Some networks allow very long nicknames (up to 32 letters). It can be annoying to have
the separator bar move too far to the right, just for one long nick. Therefore, it has
a set limit for the distance it will move to the right. If you use a large font, you
may need to adjust this distance. It is set in pixels, for example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
      /set text_max_indent 320
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Once you adjust this setting high enough, overlapping timestamps and nicknames should
not occur. The adjustment will not take effect immediately, a restart may be needed.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q211">11. How do I turn on Conference mode where I will not see join or part messages?</a></h3>
<p>
Right-click on the tab you want to change. In the submenu of the channel
name, there's a toggle-item "Show join/part messages", simply turn this off.
</p><p>If you want to turn this option on globally, type:</p>
<blockquote><pre>/set irc_conf_mode 1</pre></blockquote>
<p>Then all channels you join after setting this will start with "Show join/part messages" turned off.</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q212">12. How can I run the /dccserver command?</a></h3>
<p>
In short you can not do this (easily). This is a mIRC only proprietary feature
that is quite nonstandard. There is no code for doing this, mainly because
/dccserver runs on port 59 which in turn would require running X-Chat as
root. Why do you need this anyway? Just use normal DCC.
<br/><br/>
Unofficial <a href="http://dfx.at/xchat/">patches are available here</a>.
<br/><br/><u><b>Update</b></u>: DCC Server feature has been added in the official Windows release 2.4.1b.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q213">13. Why doesn't DCC send work behind IPNat or IPMasq?</a></h3>
<p>
   If you are behind a IP-NAT or IP-Masquerade system, you will most likely have
   an address like 192.168.0.0. This address is not usable on the Internet, and
   must be translated.
</p><p>
   When offering a DCC file, xchat will tell the receiver your address. If it says
   192.168.0.0, the receiver will not be able to connect. One way to make it send
   your "real" address is to enable the "Get my IP from IRC Server" option in xchat.
   In version 2, it's available in Preferences -> File Transfers. When you turn
   this option ON, you will have to re-login to the server before it'll take effect.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q214">14. How do I execute multiple commands in one line?</a></h3>
<p>
   There are three ways to do this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can create two UserCommands, with the same name, and then execute
the UserCommand. It will be executed in the same order as it's written
in the UserCommands GUI.</li>
<li>/LOAD -e &lt;textfile>, where &lt;textfile> is a full pathname to a file
containing commands on each line.</li>
<li>
Separate your commands with CTRL-SHIFT-a. This will appear as a little box
with numbers on it.</li>
</ul>

<br/><h3><a name="q215">15. How do I enable Emacs key bindings in XChat?</a></h3>
<p>
The standard Emacs key bindings, such as CTRL-w, CTRL-u etc, are supported by
GTK+ 2.0, but normally disabled. If you run Gnome 2, you can re-enable them in
your Gnome menu under: Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts.
</p>
<p>
<i>Note</i>: This doesn't work in the latest Gnome (2.8 and newer). In this case, you need
to run "gconf-editor", and directly change the key /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_key_theme
from "Default" to "Emacs". Then you need to re-start XChat.
</p>
<p>
If you don't use Gnome 2, but still want Emacs key bindings, it's beyond the
scope of this document. You might find some hints here:
<a href="http://www.gtk.org/gtk-2.4.0-notes.html">GTK+ 2.4.0 release notes</a>.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q216">16. I get this error: "Unknown file type abc.yz. Maybe you need to install the Perl or Python plugin?"</a></h3>
<p>
If you get this error when trying to load a Perl or Python script, it means
the plugin for running those scripts isn't loaded.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Perl, Python and TCL plugins come with XChat in the same archive.</li>
<li>During ./configure, it will check for Perl, Python and TCL libs and headers, you should check if it failed there.</li>
<li>The plugins directory can be found by issuing the shell command
	<pre>xchat -p</pre>
</li>
<li>All *.so files are auto-loaded at startup (*.dll on Windows).</li>
<li>If you downloaded a binary package, maybe the packager decided to exclude the Perl or Python plugins.</li>
</ul>

<br/><h3><a name="q217">17. How do I play sound files on certain events?</a></h3>
<p>
In the menus, go to: Settings > Preferences > Sound.
Select the event you want to make a sound on, then type in a
sound filename (or use the Browse button).
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q218">18. How do I auto-load scripts at startup?</a></h3>
<p>
You just have to place the scripts into XChat's data directory. XChat
will auto-load scripts if they have the right extension .e.g If a filename
ends in .pl, it will be loaded as a Perl script.
This data directory is different on each platform:
<br/><br/>
<u>Windows</u>
<br/><br/>
It depends on your version of Windows and where it stores the
<i><b>Application Data</b></i> folder. On Windows XP it is usually:
<br/><br/>
C:\Documents and Settings\<i><b>username</b></i>\Application Data\X-Chat 2\
<br/><br/><br/>
<u>UNIX</u>
<br/><br/>
~/.xchat2/
Where "~" represents your home directory i.e.: $HOME/.xchat2/
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q219">19. Where are the log files saved to?</a></h3>
<p>
<u>UNIX</u>
<br/>
<br/>~/.xchat2/xchatlogs/
<br/>where ~ represents your home directory.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/><u>Windows</u>
<br/>
<br/><b>Windows 95/98/Me</b>: C:\Windows\Application Data\X-Chat 2\xchatlogs
<br/><b>Windows XP/2000</b>: C:\Documents and Settings\<i><b>username</b></i>\Application Data\X-Chat 2\xchatlogs
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q220">20. How do I minimize X-Chat to the System Tray (Notification Area)?</a></h3>
<p>
There are two plugins available that allow this:
<br/>Unix: <a href="http://www.blight.tk/">SysTray Plugin</a>
<br/>Windows: <a href="http://www.sinisterdevelopments.com/">xTray</a>
</p>

<br/><h2>3. Section Three: Contributions, Development and Bugs.</h2>

<br/><h3><a name="q31">1. Why does X-Chat leak so much memory?</a></h3>
<p>
The simple answer is, it doesn't! There are some GTK+ pixmap based themes around that
leak a lot of memory. Please try using a different theme and see if that resolves the
problem. X-Chat itself only allocates about 40kb of memory through malloc()!
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q32">2. My copy of X-Chat crashes, what can I do?</a></h3>
<p>
Firstly, make sure it's the latest stable version of X-Chat. Stable versions have
an EVEN middle number, e.g.: 2.4.1 or 2.4.2. Often late fixes are placed in this
directory: <a href="http://xchat.org/files/source/2.4/patches/">2.4.x patches</a>
</p><p>
   If you still experience crashes, you should consider running it through GDB. This
   will help us find a fix quickly, and it's easy to do! See <a href="http://xchat.org/gdb/">here</a>.
</p>

<br/><h3><a name="q33">3. Can I write a new language translation for X-Chat?</a></h3>
<p>
You sure can, but I don't accept translations directly. They must be done through the
<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/HTML/index.html">Translation Project</a>.
All the relevant information should be on that page.
