X-Sys README
============
What is X-Sys?

X-Sys is a plugin for X-Chat that allows you to display your current system statistics in
a channel, private conversation or just in an echo to yourself for testing purposes.
It is supported on Linux, running on various architectures. Right now x86, ppc, ppc64, sparc,
sparc64 and alpha are supported, with parisc and ia64 implemented but awaiting testing.

---------------
Who wrote this?

X-Sys is originally a Mike Shoup creation, from the very first alpha releases to the open-source
version 1 releases. But then, things stalled. For a few months (more like a year almost)
Mike didn't work on X-Sys. The last version that had been written was 1.0.5.
The website was gone, and I (Tony) couldn't find Mike. So, I took over and improved it to my liking. 
It turned out that Mike was still around, though, he contacted me and started development again,
now called version 2, a complete rewrite. Various 1.9 betas came out that I contributed patches to,
and starting with version 2.0.0 I'm maintaining xchat-xsys again, this time with Mike's blessing.

---------------
What do I need?

- X-Chat (regular or Gnome version)
- Audacious 1.4 or higher
- D-Bus (for communication with Audacious)
- a working toolchain (compiler, binutils, etc).

------------------------------------------------
What if I get errors about u8 not being defined?

Sorry to hear that, it appears your linux distribution neglected to install essential headers on your 
system. On Debian & Ubuntu, apt-get install pciutils-dev should make it happy.

COMMANDS

X-Sys 2 has the following implemented commands:
/XSYS & /EXSYS - Output current version, either to channel or echoed on screen.
/CPUINFO & /ECPUINFO - Echoes or says current cpu statistics
/SYSUPTIME & /ESYSUPTIME - Echoes or says current uptime
/OSINFO & /EOSINFO - Echoes or says various OS statistics
/SOUND & /ESOUND - Echoes or says the current sound card, as determined by ALSA
/NETDATA & /ENETDATA - Echoes or says total amount transferred through a network
	interface. Use like: `/netdata eth0' (where eth0 is a network interface)
/NETSTREAM & /ENETSTREAM - Echoes or says amount of bandwidth being used.
	Use like: `/netstream eth0' (where eth0 is a network interface)
/DISKINFO & /EDISKINFO - Echoes or says free space on partitions. The DISK command has a
	few arguments as follows:
	ALL - Displays every partitions
	/mount - Displays free space for that specific mount point
	No arguments just displays total free space
/MEMINFO & /EMEMINFO - Echoes or says memory information.
/VIDEO & /EVIDEO - Echoes or says the current video card on the PCI bus
/ETHER & /EETHER - Echoes or says the current network card on the PCI bus
/DISTRO & /EDISTRO - Echoes or says which distro you're running
	If this doesn't work for your distro, look for a *-release file or similar in /etc
	E-mail this to chainsaw@gentoo.org

and the big one:
/SYSINFO & /ESYSINFO - Complete system information!

Two output control commands:
/XSYS2FORMAT , No arguments, it will print just the current formatting string.
   It will take any arguments to it as the formatting string.
   The formatting string can consist of any letter/numbers, and is used to format
   the output. The following special symbols can be used:
   
   %B      : Bold
   %Cnn    : Foreground Color, where nn is a number corresponding to a mIRC color
   %Cnn,nn : Foreground,Background Color
   %R      : Reverse Foreground/Background Colors
   %O      : Reset Color and Format (thats an 'oh' not a 'zero (0)')
   %C      : Reset Color
   %U      : Underline 

/PLAYING will either print or allow you to set the text for /np.
The default is now_playing, but you can set this to whatever text you prefer.

/PERCENTAGES will allow you to set whether to use percentages in plugin output or not.
Percentages are enabled  by default. Use a zero value to disable, and a non-zero value
to enable. If unsure, use 1.

/NP & /ENP - Reports what's currently playing in Audacious.
