INSTALLATION
============
Installation is straightforward. You need Audacious 1.4 or higher and D-Bus.
Open up the Makefile, check to make sure PCIIDS points to your pci.ids file.
	(Symptom if you get it wrong: raw PCI ID's (XXXX:XXXX) emitted by /VIDEO and friends).

Run: make
Run: make install

Voila!

NOTES:
`make install' copies the compiled library (something like xsys-v.v.v.so) to
$HOME/.xchat2/xsys-plugin.so for autoloading. If $HOME/.xchat2/xsys-plugin.so
exists, it is removed first.
