   reset, fg changes to 2 and the comma is printed (Fuentes Xavier).
 - xtext: a fix for multibyte text wrapping (Tetsuo YAMAMOTO).
 - Made notify NOT announce everyone offline when you first login.
 - Multiple WATCHes are sent on one line for notifies, to reduce lag.

   might want to remove the old usercommand (Tobias v. Koch). 
 - Banlist window now sends multiple modes per line.
 - Fixed a memory leak in perl (Martin Persson).
 - Removed the tooltip for userlistinfo, it seemed to cause corruption
   on some gtk+ themes.
 - Made xchat not interpret %C,%B etc when percascii is OFF, .e.g:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.7.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Re-added support for '+' channels when there's no 005 numeric.
 - Made the new $3 null terminated (works better that way).
 - Fixed Doubleclick-user when disabling userlist icons.
 - Fixed SSL build.
 - Win32 port (some code from Alex Badea's 1.5.11win32 port used).
 - More code cleanups, removed all extern prototypes from fe-gtk/.
 - Titlebar text now shows unknown channel modes too.
 - Made persist chans work with /reconnect aswell.
 - Avoid pastes of common unix directories being treated as irc
   commands (Chema Celorio). 
 - Removed the Delete word forward/backward functions from
   KeyBindings. GTK handles these already, why were they ever there?
 - Made %h work for dialog windows' popup menu too.
 - Fixed treeview not setting channels red and blue.
 - The info above the userlist now gets a tooltip which gives you
   some extra info.
 - The nickgad (to the left of your nickname) now gets a text prefix
   char if userlist icons are disabled.
 - Timestamp format is now configurable in Setup->IRC Input/Output.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.7.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - xtext: tweaks to make url highlights less flickery.
 - Added some support for ircd numeric 005. MODES>=6, CHANTYPES,
   CHANMODES, WATCH and PREFIX are supported. This means dynamic
   support of different channel and user modes. The userlist icons
   only support *@%+ though (admin, op, half op, voice), will have to
   find a way to make these dynamic in the future. Also, made a new
   file modes.c and rewrote mode handling in general to support this,
   so what did I break?
 - Added option 'Userlist icons' (default ON). Lets you turn off
   userlist icons for ops, voice etc and get the plain text @+ (in
   Setup->Interface). Might be useful for ircd's that have weird
   and wacky access levels.
 - Added support for WATCH command for use in notify list. Numeric 005
   must list WATCH for this to work.
 - Added an extra arg $3 for channel message printevents. This is the
   prefix char of the person talking, e.g. '@' for Ops.
 - Resolve irc-server name only if using a non-socks4 proxy. This
   allows you to connect even with a non-working dns. Also made the
   socks5 code more "correct" (Richard Fuchs).
 - Some code cleanups, got rid of most of the extern functions in c
   files and moved them to h files.
 - Perl has a valid context at startup again (broken in 1.7.4).
 - Fixed leak of awaymessages for "Show away once" feature.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.7.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Fixed some buggy catalogs for gettext 0.10.37 (OpenBSD users).
   Compiling with 0.10.35 will now break, there's always
   ./configure disable-nls.
 - Fixed python autoloading due to new serverlistcode (Richard Fuchs).
 - Made perl/python/plugins autoload when first irc window is open
   (rather than when serverlist opens), incase they need to print.
 - Changed serverlist opening behaviour. It now obays the
   'No ServerList on startup' setting regardless of auto-connects.
 - Fixed buggy Quit menu item (1.7.4 bug).
 - DCC cleanups, including some endian fixes.
 - DCC windows don't go to front when new xfers appear (1.7.3 bug).
 - Rewrites to a few vital xtext functions. This seems to have speed
   up rendering with a FontSet and fix the -/+1 line bug.
 - Fixed Shelltab not opening sometimes (actually a 1.7.4 ipv6 bug).
 - Added ability to change font for Shelltabs only:
   /set font_shell <fontname>


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.7.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - On startup, serverlist now opens without any other windows, looks
   neater, less confusing for newbies. If you disable serverlist at
   startup, a normal irc will open instead.
 - Made a few things more userfriendly, "DCC Send" -> "File Send". No
   need to refer to the protocol in the GUI!
 - Fixed a xtext bug rendering a background color of 1 incorrectly.
 - Unprintable characters used to cause problems to xtext (who would
   have thought gdk_char_width returns a different value to
   gdk_text_width?) - fixed.
 - xtext renders only once when switching tabs (used to render twice
   because gtk gives us 2 expose signals, why?).
 - When you change your nick it changes in the titlebar now too.
   Server name is now reported in dialog windows' titlebar.
 - Having Strip mIRC Color ON will now strip it from dcc chats too.
 - Added (really this time) perl functions add_user_list,
   sub_user_list, clear_user_list for manipulating the userlist of a
   channel (Lloyd Williams).
 - Various code cleanups, including a rewrite of the IPv6 code.
   Removed /6server and 'Use IPv6' check-box in the serverlist. It
   automatically handles IPv6/IPv4 addresses now.
 - Added a check-box in the serverlist edit window for "Use Proxy".


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.7.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Added server hostname as $3 for quit print event (Bjorn Olievier).
 - Some fixes to the gnomepanel code. Panel no longer asks to restart
   applet on quit, removing the applet doesn't exit xchat (George).
 - Fixed fd leaks in /exec and python (Richard Fuchs).
 - user@host gets logged in query windows (Richard Fuchs).
 - Fixed the 'Marked Away' & 'Save Settings on exit' check menu items
   (when using --disable-gnome).
 - Workaround for ipv6 build failing on some glibcs (Tobias von Koch).
 - DCC won't try to resume if local file is bigger than remote offer.
 - Fixed xtext drawing/wordwrap and textmarking bugs.
 - Horizontal scrollbar appears in channellist window when needed.
 - Fixed color paste. Does this affect multibyte pasting? Please
   report (Darell Tan).
 - Fixed titlebar text for notices/snotices tabs.
 - The topic box gets a tooltip of the current topic.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.7.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Fixed some Python mem leaks and signal/event handlers can now
   return non-null integer to tell xchat to stop processing the event
   (like perl handling functions) (Richard Fuchs).
 - Got rid of the Linger timeout. This was a lame solution to stop the
   loss of QUIT messages when closing the socket too early. Now xchat
   just delays closing sockets by 5 seconds (even on quiting the app).
   No more 1 second delay when you close a tab or the whole app!
 - Fixed some memory leaks in the banlist window.
 - Added 'B' channel-mode button to access the banlist.
 - Added Turkish translation (Ozgur Dogan GUNES).
 - Updated Spanish translation (Antonio de la Torre).
 - Fixed the throttle setting (which was reversed! who did that?).
 - Added IRC::notify_list. (Matthew Gabeler-Lee).
 - Don't crash when bind fails for dcc send.
 - Don't send garbage to server when ban_type is invalid.
 - Rewrote a whole heap of bad code in maingui.c. When opening a new
   tab/window it always uses the same functions instead of having the
   code repeated a few times. This is pretty big so expect some things
   to break. This also means dcc/chanlist etc tabs get the < > buttons
   too.
 - /KICKBAN now deops users first (Tobias von Koch).


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.7.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Turning off server tabs should work again (1.7.0 bug).
 - Some ipv6 fixes.
 - Added a few TextEvents that used to be hardcoded.
 - Updated jcode (Takuo Kitame).
 - Fixed possible crash in palette window (1.7.0 bug).
 - Rewrote the EscapeCode->mIRC color conversion for /exec.
 - Added option to explicitly set your dcc IP (Jim Seymour).
 - Added Opera and w3m to default URL Handlers.
 - New serverlist/window icon - just for a change.
 - Updated Korean translation (Kim SeungBaeck).
 - Added hook_timeout to the XChat.XChat() python class so you can
   XChat.XChat().hook_timeout(delay, handler). It is a one time
   function like the perl version (Donald Kjer).
 - /RECONNECT can now takes args like /SERVER, the difference
   being that it'll rejoin all your channels (Angel).


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.7.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Updated German translation (Benedikt Roth).
 - Updated Spanish translation (Antonio de la Torre).
 - Updated Japanese translation (Takuo Kitame).

 - Away status and reason is re-send to the server if you get
   disconnected (Daniel Rall).
 - Added option to have one tab for notices, configurable under
   Inferface/Window layout (Alex Badea).
 - Added another meter component that measures the server send queue
   from the throttle system (pref: throttlemeter), added UI support
   for showing the lag and throttle as either progress bars, info
   boxes, both, or none (Alex Badea).
 - Added a command to flush the send queue (/FLUSHQ) and one for
   forcing a new lag check (/LAGCHECK) (Alex Badea).
 - Added option 'persist_chans', when ON once a session is created
   for a channel, no other channel will be assigned to that session,
   regardless of any parts or kicks (Alex Badea).
 - Compile errors while loading a perl script are printed on the main
   window. Warnings issued by perl scripts are also printed on the
   main window. This allows script writers to use the perl command
   'warn' to point out strange things. Perl errors no longer make
   xchat crash. The error message is written on the main window and
   the command execution is stopped (Frodo Baggins).
 - Added IPv6 support for making server connections. See
   ./configure --enable-ipv6 and /6SERVER command (\\bonxo\\@IRCnet).
 - Added Banlist window (Salvatore Insalaco).
 - You can now specify which dir ssl is in, e.g.: ./configure
   --enable-openssl=/usr/local/ssl (Richard Fuchs).

 - Added option /SET percascii, which can disable/enable translation

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.6.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - xtext: Fixed lockup with certain sized fonts.
 - xtext: Made some changes to improve efficiency when using really
   large scrollback buffers (only noticable when doublebuffer off).
 - Fixed a bug in /help crashing on longer than 10 char UserCommands.

 - Fixed the channelmode buttons mouse-over problem.
 - Fixed percentage display for large files in dcc recv/send gui.
 - StartTime in dcc chat gui no longer Jan 1 1970.

   url highlighting when double buffer is OFF.
 - xtext: Fixed a very rare bug that could cause BadGC errors or the
   separator bar not to be drawn.
 - Fixed crash in right-clicking URLs in the URL Grabber window.

   actually work again.
 - USER login command now sends your nodename instead of 'localhost'

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.5.11
----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.5.10
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Added "Enable double buffer" toggle in Setup->Channel windows.
 - Double buffer is now OFF by default (seems to use less CPU).
 - Timestamps didn't turn ON while indent was OFF - fixed.
 - Updated Swedish translation (Christian Rose).
 - Added some extra text events: Channel Msg hilight, Channel
   Action hilight (near top of the list). No more cardcoded color
   codes! Also hilighting in actions works, and you can make the whole
   message hilighted if you change the event text.
 - Initial window size is actually set to your settings (this will
   never be perfect I guess, sometimes to the window still resizes
   itself without warning).
 - Hidemenubar setting didn't work properly for non-tabs and when
   delinking windows - fixed.
 - Notices appear in front tab even when server tabs are enabled.
 - Changed Away behaviour again. No more /back, /away with no args
   brings you back. The menu-item's state is what the server tells
   it, it even changes when you switch tabs to another server. Xchat
   assumes you are not away when you first connect. irc::get_info(5)
   returns the away state. One day the other UserModes menu items will
   show correct states. Is everyone happy now?
 - Translation tables didn't work for outgoing text - fixed.
 - Cleaned up a few xchat.conf names, a few settings may not load up
   from 1.5.9 - just set them again.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.5.9
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Updated Spanish translation (Antonio de la Torre).
 - Added Hebrew translation (Dan Fruehauf).
 - Fixed crash bug when partreason was not set.
 - Dialog tabs obay the hidetopicbar setting now too (the one in the
   right-click menu).
 - Cleaned up the settings gui: the whole window is more compact now,
   some toggles in two columns, numbers use a spin-button, entry boxes
	are larger and option-menus are more consistant.
 - The "o=xx v=xx t=xx" display is finally changed.
 - Changed most of xtext.c to use gdk instead of Xlib.
 - Added configure option:
        --disable-xlib    disable use of xlib (for non X11 systems)
   This might help compile xchat on other GTK supported systems like
   BeOS and Win32 (havn't tried it though).
 - Neater /set list.
 - You can now set a nickname per server (see serverlist edit window).
 - Changed the behaviour of /away and added /back (James Crawford).
 - Away reason can now be a text file of random reasons too.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

   even if on-screen timestamps are off (Mike Guidero).
 - Added entry "Part Reason: ". Also part and quit reasons can be
   a filename of random reasons (filename relative to ~/.xchat/).
 - Took out /unban as a internal command, add it as a usercommand
   /quote MODE %c -b &2 instead.
 - Added a text event for banlist. Try /banlist and it'll be a bit
   more readable now.
 - Changed output throttle system (undernet style) (Alex Badea).
 - Added 1 second linger socket option to stop QUIT msgs from being
   lost (they still get lost sometimes, why?).


----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Fixed transparency-leak problems in 1.5.6
 - New code to create shaded transparency, taken from latest zvt.
   (is it better?)

   (http://www.securityfocus.com/vdb/bottom.html?vid=1601)
 - Fixed a bug in xchat.conf and serverlist.conf loading.
 - When spliting msgs (longer than the IRC 512 limit), it used to
   loose some chars - fixed.
 - Added feature to choose DCC port range            (Lars Sundqvist).
 - Fixed perl-stack overflow probs in irc::userlist() and others.
   Added perl functions user_list_short() and perl_script_list()
                                                       (Mike Guidero).
 - MHz is now detected on FreeBSD 4.x/5.x           (Jonathan Perkin).

 - Fixed a problem with the usermenu not updating sometimes.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.5.5 -> 1.5.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Added option pingtimeout, which pings the server instead. 
   /set pingtimeout 90 is default (small values will malfunction).
   You also need the lagometer enabled for this to work.
 - No longer using fnmatch() for ignore etc (because the way it
   handles [ and ]). Using function from ircu2.10.08.
 - Some fixes to code & configure.in to make it compile using
   Solaris C (Albert Chin).
 - New Spanish translation (Antonio de la Torre).
 - New Russian translation (Alex Samorukov).
 - New Hungarian translation (Horvath Szabolcs).
 - Added Portuguese translation (Vitor Antunes).
 - Added Slovak translation (Martin Pekar).
 - Added /allserv <cmd> and /allchan <cmd>. They send a command to
   all currently connected servers and joined channels. Also added
   usercommands /ame and /amsg which make use of this.
 - Added sock5 traversal, see Setup->Proxy Server (Alex Badea).
   (The numbers for proxy_type are now 0=disabled, 1=wingate,
    2=socks4, 3=socks5).
 - A few more buffer overflow checks (nick & channel length).
 - Mapped mIRC color 99 to "no background" (mIRC lame!).
 - Some efficiency tweaks to xtext.
 - Added SSL support (see --enable-openssl and /help server) (DaP).
   This seems to be highly experimental, as I don't know of any IRC
   servers that can do SSL yet.
 - Changed history behaviour, more like GNU (DaP).
   i.e. Doesn't wrap and the bottom line is blank.
 - Added option "InputBox Always In Focus" (DaP).
 - Added option "Show Nickgad" (DaP).
 - Added option "Show invites in the active Window" (DaP).
 - Added option "Send /Whois" in notifies section, which sends a
   /whois when someone comes online (DaP).
 - Added an event for numeric 341, you inivited someone (DaP).
 - Title bar text changed/improved a bit (DaP).
 - Added actions for EditKeyBindings: MoveFrontTabLeft and
   MoveFrontTabRight, like the <> buttons, but for keyboard (DaP).
 - Implemented timeout events in the text frontend (Alex Badea and
   fixed by me :).
 - Dcc Recv/Send tabs won't resize the window when open.
 - Added configure option --disable-glib.
 - Transparent windows update when background changes (Aaron Lehmann).
 - serverlist.conf is slightly changed! You WILL be able to load your
   old 1.5.5 or 1.4.x server list, but older versions WON'T load lists
   from 1.5.6, so backup your serverlist.conf if you need to.
 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.5.4 -> 1.5.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Fix for show/hide menu under gnome.
 - Added -a and --noauto arg (don't auto connect to any servers).
 - Added internal /list command, which sends the correct args according
   to ircd type (it detects undernet and dalnet to send >0,<10000).
   Remove any old /list usercommands you might have.
 - /op /deop ... etc send up to six modes per line if using undernet.
 - As discussed in the mailinglist, changed DCC resume to send and
   expect to receive ACKs as an absolute, rather than an offset from
   the resume point. It *should* work with mIRC now, but break with
   old versions of xchat and probably BitchX.
 - Added option "Limited Tab Highlighting" (Francis Litterio).


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.5.3 -> 1.5.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Lack of gdk_pixbuf is detected correctly now (configure script).
 - textmarking is no longer a timeout event, is this better or worse?
 - Added Turkish translation (Fatih Demir).
 - Added Russian translation (Valek Filippov).
 - Added Ukrainian translation (Yuri Syrota).
 - Added configure option --disable-zvt. Also, zvt shell tab can be
   compiled in even without gnome (and is by default, if gnome-config
   can be found to provide the LDFLAGS).
 - Added "Delete Word Forward" function in Edit Key Bindings. Bind
   this to Alt-d for that emacs feel (Francis Litterio). 
 - Ping times show one extra decimal place.
 - You can now hide the menubar too, click left mouse in the text area
   to get a popup version of the menu (middle mouse in dialogs).
 - Added the proxy settings to the GUI, Setup->IRC->Proxy Server.
 - Added a keyword TOGGLE for usermenu. Delete your old usermenu.conf
   to see the new default one.
 - Configure script now cleans up the CFLAGS & LDFLAGS (removes
   duplicate words), let's hope this doesn't break on some boxses.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.5.2 -> 1.5.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Fixed a rare overflow bug in auto_insert().
 - Pressing OK in the settings window on slow machines (p233?) was
   pretty slow, maybe it's faster now.
 - Corrected some inputgad behaviour (Aaron Lehmann).
 - Fix for 64bit machines (alpha) in xtext (word clicks).
 - Updated German translation (Benedikt Roth).
 - Updated Danish translation (Birger Langkjer).
 - If you disconnect (/discon, /quit...) a server during the reconnect
   delay, it is actually removed now.
 - Added option "Give the userlist style" (DaP).
 - Translation tables support can be turned off (--disable-trans), for
   you minimalist freaks.
 - Added Hebrew support, compile time: --enable-hebrew, run time:
   /set hebrew 0/1 (Dan Aloni).
 - Added new setting, "nick completion character" (Francis Litterio).
 - Added new setting, "Old-style Nickname Completion", which makes it
   act much like 1.4.x (Francis Litterio).
 - Added "Delete Word" function to EditKeyBindings (Francis Litterio).
 - Now using gdk-pixbuf for decoding pictures and tinted transparency.
	(Tints don't seem to work 100% yet). (Andreas Persenius).
 - Added halfop support (mode +h). This includes support in the
   userlist, /hop, /dehop, /mdehop and new textevents (Elizandro G. Roos).


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.5.1 -> 1.5.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - --disable-gnome should work again.
 - Fixed a bug in right-click nick menu.
 - Should compile with glibc 2.1.3 (no more 'struct user' errors).
 - Added Romanian translation (Dan Damian).
 - CTCP flood protection won't kick in for ACTIONs.
 - Removed the theme code.
 - Made pixmaps.c, all code to decode/free/etc pixmaps is in here.
 - WM_HINTS icon is set for the app.
 - Removed the "-c" flag (it's automatic now).


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.5.0 -> 1.5.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Shell tabs are now delinkable.
 - Added a "show/hide topic bar" button (bottom right), I didn't know
   where else to put this.
 - Hidding the userlist is saved and any new tabs/windows open will
   have the userlist hidden.
 - You can now turn off/on perl warnings with /set perlwarnings 0/1.
 - Tab-key nick completion even more like GNU readline (Gerard Daubar).
 - Rewrote the function that handles %variables in userlist buttons,
   user commands and ctcp replies (all use the same function now),
   please report any bugs (especially if someone can overflow you from
   remote ;) - as a consequence, you can use % and & (word/word_eol)
   for ctcp replies now. Also added %m for machine info.
 - Nickname-popup-menu, URLmenu and Usermenu all use the same code now
   (it means you can make submenus in all 3).
 - Double eval back in perl.c
 - Dialogs/querys also have a toolbox button (just for consistancy).
 - Added lagometer (/set lagometer 0 to turn it off), this isn't quiet
   finished yet (and doesn't work on IRCNet because it refuses to
   reply to pings correctly).


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.4.2 -> 1.5.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Some changes & cleanups to the parser code (inbound/outbound).
 - Ran all source through indent, using:
           indent -bli0 -bls -ce -ts3 -i3
    (please use this in your patches, I used GNU indent 2.2.4).
 - If you send a message (channel or query window) longer than 512
   bytes (maximum allowed by the ircd) it will be split into two
   smaller messages instead of being truncated.
 - Some gui touchups and changes.
 - You can now enable/disable the output throttle with /set throttle.
 - Added /timer.

   with transparency turned off - fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Fixed a bug that could make new text not appear while marking text.
 - xtext: Further improved performance when double buffering is turned
          off (marking text & URL hilights are almost flicker free).
 - xtext: Double buffer is now freed at each render operation, this
          should reduce memory usage if you have many tabs open.
 - If you closed a server while it was in the reconnect-delay, xchat
   would crash - fixed.
 - No more zombies when doing /discon while connection in progress.

   (If someone wants to update these, you're welcome to).
 - Channel mode "+h nick" (half Op) is now reported correctly (still
   not supported in the userlist though).
 - Having indent nicks OFF in channel windows and ON in dialog windows
   didn't work - fixed.
