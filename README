What is it?
~~~~~~~~~~~
 HexChat is an IRC client for UNIX operating systems. I.R.C. is Internet
 Relay Chat, see http://irchelp.org for more information about IRC in
 general. HexChat runs on most BSD and POSIX compliant operating systems.


Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * GTK+ 2.10 (this is available at http://www.gtk.org).

 HexChat is known to work on, at least:

	* Linux
	* FreeBSD
	* OpenBSD
	* NetBSD
	* Solaris
	* AIX
	* IRIX
	* DEC/Compaq Tru64 UNIX
	* HP-UX 10.20 and 11
	* MacOS X
	* Windows XP/2000/Vista/7


Notes for packagers:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 If you need your packages to work on i386, you don't need to compile with
 --disable-mmx, because it's also checked at run-time.


Python Scripts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Scripts for 1.8.x are not compatible, and a brand new interface has be
 written. Documentation can be found here: http://xchat.org/docs/.
 Consider using the Python interface for your scripts, it's a very nice
 API, allows for loading/unloading individual scripts, and gives you
 almost all the features of the C-Plugin API.


Perl Scripts:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Scripts for 1.8.x are compatible with the following exceptions:

* IRC::command will not interpret %C, %B, %U etc.

* user_list and user_list_short:
  If a user has both op and voice, only the op flag will be 1.

* add_user_list/sub_user_list/clear_user_list
  These functions do nothing.

* notify_list
  Not implemented. Always returns an empty list.

* server_list
  Lists servers that are not connected aswell.

* Some print events may have new names and some were added.

* Text printed by scripts must now be UTF8.

* Text passed to scripts (via add_message_handler) will be encoded in UTF8.


Autoloading Perl Scripts and Plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * HexChat automatically loads, at startup:
	~/.xchat2/*.pl Perl scripts
	~/.xchat2/*.py Python scripts
	~/.xchat2/*.so Plugins
	$(libdir)/xchat/plugins/*.so plugins
	(this usually translates to /usr/lib/xchat/plugins/*.so)


Control Codes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 %%     -  A single percentage sign
 %C     -  Control-C (mIRC color code)
 %B     -  Bold Text
 %U     -  Underline Text
 %R     -  Reverse Text
 %O     -  Reset all Text attributes
 %XXX   -  ASCII XXX (where XXX is a decimal 3 digit number)
           (Eg: %007 sends a BEEP)

 %Cforeground,background will produce a color code, eg: %C03,10

 These are now disabled by default (see Settings > Prefs > Input Box).
 Instead you can insert the real codes via ctrl-k, ctrl-b and ctrl-o.
